This is the Django app where I use Bootstrap Html CSS Javascript for frontend And Python for backend. 
Here I just use CRUD Functionality. Where User Can add Employee Name Email and password.And the data stored in Database Sqlite Which Django provides By default.
And the all data displays in the same page. And user can Edit data And delete entry.
